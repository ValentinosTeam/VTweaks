## Plans
- **Enable/Disable features** - Enable or disable features through commands in game.
- **Item enchantment forbidding** - Forbid enchanting certain items.
- **Item crafting unusability** - Forbid certain items from being used in recipes.
- **Custom potion effects** - Add custom potion effects.
- **Help and list commands** - List all available commands and help for each command.
- and more...
